# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code when working in this repository.

## ⚠️ FIRST THING TO DO IN EVERY NEW SESSION

**If `data/train.csv` does not exist, run `./bootstrap.sh` before anything else.**

Containers are ephemeral — competition data is re-downloaded on each fresh
session. `bootstrap.sh` installs deps and fetches `train.csv`, `test.csv`,
and `sample_submission.csv` via `kaggle competitions download`. It
auto-uses the `KAGGLE_API_TOKEN` env var (already configured at the
container level) and falls back to an interactive prompt if absent.

Do **not** use `download_data.py` to get the competition data — that
script targets the optional `l3llff/irrigation-water` *dataset* (real-
world data the synthetic set was generated from), not the competition.

## Competition

- **Name**: Predicting Irrigation Need (Playground Series - Season 6, Episode 4)
- **URL**: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s6e4
- **Slug**: `playground-series-s6e4`
- **Task**: 3-class classification (`Low` / `Medium` / `High`) on tabular data
- **Metric**: balanced accuracy (macro-recall)
- **Deadline**: ~2026-04-30 (10 days to go as of 2026-04-20 — confirm on Timeline page)
- **LB submission budget**: 10 / day, 2 final submissions selected, 0 spent at kickoff
- **Team size limit**: 3
- **Data license**: CC BY 4.0

### 2026-04-20 — first submission, CV↔LB calibrated

- Goal: spend one submission to answer whether the 0.98114 tied pack
  is running argmax or already tuned, so downstream decisions aren't
  based on guesses about the pack.
- Changed: `submissions/submission_baseline_lgbm_tuned.csv` committed
  to the repo (gitignore exception) and uploaded to Kaggle.
- Result: **LB public = 0.96972** at rank 726 / 2357 (top 31%).
- OOF vs LB: 0.97097 − 0.96972 = **−0.00125**, inside one fold-std
  (~0.002). CV is well-calibrated; future experiment deltas from
  5-fold OOF can be trusted.
- Read-out: the pack is NOT running raw argmax (that would have landed
  them near our 0.96 tier). They have structural advantages — feature
  engineering, original dataset, seed bagging, better hyperparameters,
  or some combination. Our earlier hypothesis "the pack already uses
  the threshold trick" is confirmed.
- LB budget: 1 / 10 spent today; 9 remaining.
- Gap math for remaining budget: stacking best-case expected deltas
  from NEXT_STEPS steps 3–6 → ~+0.007 → ~0.977, still below the pack
  (0.98114). Step 2 (original dataset) is the swing factor: +0.004 of
  lift from it would put us in pack territory; negative / flat means
  we need to look at the public-notebook recipe.
- Next bet: execute step 2 (original-dataset ablation) and step 3
  (domain features into LGBM) in parallel — both are cheap enough to
  fit in one session, and step 2 alone resolves the biggest
  uncertainty in the remaining plan.

### LB state at kickoff (2026-04-20)

- **Top score (rank 1)**: 0.98219 — Chris Deotte
- **Rank 100 score**: 0.98114 (huge tied pack at exactly 0.98114 from ~100 through 108+)
- **Gap top ↔ tied pack**: ~0.00105 (~1 part in 1000)
- **First submission (tuned LGBM)**: 0.96972, rank 726/2357
- Implication: beating the 0.98114 "default model" pack is a hard floor
  (basically everyone ran a straightforward LGBM/XGB on the raw features).
  Real gains come from out-of-the-pack tricks: threshold tuning for
  balanced accuracy, adding the original irrigation dataset, careful
  feature engineering, or DGP archaeology on the synthetic data.

## Session log

### 2026-04-20 — kickoff

- Goal: bootstrap the repo, capture brief/rules/LB state, set up Kaggle
  credentials, and queue a first experiment that beats the 0.98114 tied pack.
- Changed: scaffold in place (template + kaggle-kickoff skill); `brief.md`
  populated with competition description, evaluation (balanced accuracy),
  rules, column list, and flagged invariances; `CLAUDE.md` now reflects
  LB state and download commands; competition data downloaded to `data/`
  (train 630k × 20, test 270k × 19).
- LB delta: n/a (not yet submitted).
- Data finding: **class distribution is severely skewed** — Low 58.7%,
  Medium 37.9%, High 3.3%. Under balanced accuracy this means the `High`
  class drives the scoreboard; per-class threshold tuning is the highest-
  expected-value first experiment.
- Next bet: LGBM baseline on raw + target-encoded categoricals, OOF probs
  from stratified 5-fold CV, then grid/Brent search over per-class
  thresholds maximizing macro-recall. Submit only after comparing OOF
  balanced accuracy of argmax vs tuned decision rule — if tuned rule
  doesn't beat argmax on OOF, re-examine before burning a sub.

### 2026-04-20 — benchmarks + EDA report

- Goal: land a reproducible EDA (on a held-out subsample) and a dummy +
  LGBM benchmark with decision-rule ablation on OOF.
- Changed: `scripts/eda.py` now stratified-subsamples 50% of train
  (seed=42) and emits `plots/eda/report.html`, a self-contained HTML
  with embedded PNGs + feature-signal ranking tables; `scripts/benchmark.py`
  runs the 5-fold stratified LGBM pipeline and saves OOF + test probs
  to `scripts/artifacts/`; `submissions/baseline_lgbm_{argmax,tuned}.csv`
  generated but not submitted.
- Results (OOF balanced accuracy, seed=42, 5-fold CV):
  - majority / random baselines → 0.3333 (floor)
  - LGBM argmax → 0.96135
  - LGBM prior-reweight argmax → 0.97065 (+0.0093)
  - **LGBM tuned log-bias → 0.97097** (+0.0003 over prior-reweight)
- Best log-bias: Low +0.23, Medium +0.67, High +3.40 — matches the
  balanced-accuracy intuition that `High` needs a large positive bump.
- Confusion-matrix mass lives in Medium↔High; Low is essentially
  solved.
- LB delta: n/a (still no submissions; 10/10 day budget intact).
- Next bet: we're ~0.010 below the 0.98114 tied pack with a
  no-feature-engineering single-seed LGBM. Cheapest gains: (a) 3–5
  seed bag of LGBM, (b) richer feature interactions (esp.
  Soil_Moisture × Rainfall, Crop_Growth_Stage × Mulching_Used), (c)
  try XGBoost or CatBoost and blend.

### 2026-04-20 — domain primer, heuristics, linear formulas, blend

- Goal: build a physical frame of reference (non-tree baselines) so we
  understand how much of the LGBM score is "equation" vs "interaction",
  and test whether weaker models bring orthogonal signal.
- Changed: `DOMAIN.md` (soil-water balance equation, feature-to-term
  mapping, Indian cropping-season context, FAO-56 Kc lookup, soil
  field-capacity lookup); `scripts/heuristic.py` (no-training,
  threshold-fit-per-fold predictor); `scripts/formula_mnlogit.py` (three
  hand-crafted MNLogit formulas F1/F2/F3); `scripts/benchmark_multi.py`
  (XGBoost done, CatBoost killed at fold 1); `scripts/blend_lgbm_mnlogit.py`
  (blend sweep).
- Results (OOF balanced accuracy, 5-fold stratified, seed=42):
  - Heuristic H1 (Soil_Moisture alone): 0.62911
  - Heuristic H2 (raw water balance, equal z-wts): 0.60606
  - Heuristic H3 (H2 + Kc + mulch + soil cap): 0.63041
  - MNLogit F1 tuned: 0.64721
  - MNLogit F2 tuned: 0.78074
  - MNLogit F3 tuned: 0.73294
  - LGBM tuned (prior result): 0.97097
  - XGBoost tuned (per-fold ~0.961–0.964): ~0.962
  - CatBoost fold-1 argmax: 0.96000 (killed; no edge)
  - LGBM + MNLogit blend (sweep w∈[0,0.5]): Δ = +0.00000
- Observations:
  - Soil_Moisture alone (H1) reaches ~2/3 of the distance from random
    to competitive. The single feature carries a huge fraction of the
    signal, matching its F-stat lead (~82k, 4× the next feature).
  - H2 < H1: equal-weight z-scoring dilutes a dominant signal.
    Heuristic-weight choice is a decision, not a free parameter.
  - H3 ≈ H1: Kc + mulch + capacity add ~0.001 — directionally right,
    too crude to beat the "just sort by soil moisture" baseline.
  - MNLogit F2 > F3: dropping main effects in favor of interactions
    under L2 regularization is an inefficient parameterization.
  - LGBM → H3 = +0.34 bal_acc on the *same* physical features — so
    the dominant gain is from nonlinear interactions, not feature
    selection. Any hand-engineered linear combination is a floor, not
    a ceiling.
  - Blend null result confirms MNLogit is simply too weak to add to
    LGBM. Model-diversity gains need a *strong* second model.
- LB delta: still n/a (0/10 day budget consumed).
- Next bet: feature engineering on LGBM (plug F2/H3 engineered cols
  into LGBM training), seed-bag LGBM, LGBM+XGB blend, then test the
  original Irrigation Prediction dataset as an ablation. Ranked list
  with expected deltas lives in REPORT.md §4.

## Hypothesis board

- **Open**:
  - Incorporating the original Irrigation Prediction dataset (explicitly
    allowed) may help, but may also hurt if its DGP differs from the
    synthetic train distribution. Test as a controlled ablation.
  - The huge tie at 0.98114 suggests a "ceiling" from the public baseline
    everyone is running. Room to move is likely in (a) ensembling across
    seeds/models, (b) threshold tuning, (c) leveraging the ordinal
    structure (`Low < Medium < High`) via ordinal-aware losses despite
    the metric being order-agnostic.
  - Most of the residual error is Medium↔High confusion. Feature
    interactions that separate these two classes (e.g. Soil_Moisture ×
    Rainfall_mm, Crop_Growth_Stage × Mulching_Used) should move bal_acc.
- **Confirmed**:
  - Default `argmax` is suboptimal under balanced accuracy when classes
    are imbalanced → prior-reweight + coord-ascent log-bias moves OOF
    from 0.96135 → 0.97097 (+0.0096). Keep this as the decision rule
    for every subsequent model.
- **Ruled out**:
  - **Equal-weight z-score fusion of water-balance axes** (H2) is
    worse than the single-feature Soil_Moisture rule (H1). Any future
    hand-weighted score needs per-axis weights proportional to
    informativeness, not uniform.
  - **Blending MNLogit into LGBM** adds 0.00000 at any mixing weight.
    Linear model is too weak (0.78 vs 0.97) to contribute orthogonal
    signal; parked as possible stacking feature only.
  - **CatBoost as a standalone competitor** — fold-1 argmax 0.96000 ≈
    LGBM/XGB, 23 min/fold training cost, killed after fold 1. Could
    revisit as a 4th blend member only if compute budget allows late.
- **Parked**:
  - Seed recovery / DGP archaeology on the synthetic generator — high
    effort, unclear payoff with only 10 days; revisit if stuck above
    0.9815.

## Playbook

The reusable Kaggle playbook lives at
