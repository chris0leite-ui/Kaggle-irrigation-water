## Competition

- **Name**: Predicting Irrigation Need (Playground Series - Season 6, Episode 4)
- **URL**: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s6e4
- **Slug**: `playground-series-s6e4`
- **Task**: 3-class classification (`Low` / `Medium` / `High`) on tabular data
- **Metric**: balanced accuracy (macro-recall)
- **Deadline**: ~2026-04-30 (10 days to go as of 2026-04-20 — confirm on Timeline page)
- **LB submission budget**: 10 / day, 2 final submissions selected, 0 spent at kickoff
- **Team size limit**: 3
- **Data license**: CC BY 4.0

### LB state at kickoff (2026-04-20)

- **Top score (rank 1)**: 0.98219 — Chris Deotte
- **Rank 100 score**: 0.98114 (huge tied pack at exactly 0.98114 from ~100 through 108+)
- **Gap top ↔ tied pack**: ~0.00105 (~1 part in 1000)
- **Not yet submitted**
- Implication: beating the 0.98114 "default model" pack is a hard floor
  (basically everyone ran a straightforward LGBM/XGB on the raw features).
  Real gains come from out-of-the-pack tricks: threshold tuning for
  balanced accuracy, adding the original irrigation dataset, careful
  feature engineering, or DGP archaeology on the synthetic data.

## Session log

### 2026-04-20 — kickoff

- Goal: bootstrap the repo, capture brief/rules/LB state, set up Kaggle
  credentials, and queue a first experiment that beats the 0.98114 tied pack.
- Changed: scaffold in place (template + kaggle-kickoff skill); `brief.md`
  populated with competition description, evaluation (balanced accuracy),
  rules, column list, and flagged invariances; `CLAUDE.md` now reflects
  LB state and download commands; competition data downloaded to `data/`
  (train 630k × 20, test 270k × 19).
- LB delta: n/a (not yet submitted).
- Data finding: **class distribution is severely skewed** — Low 58.7%,
  Medium 37.9%, High 3.3%. Under balanced accuracy this means the `High`
  class drives the scoreboard; per-class threshold tuning is the highest-
  expected-value first experiment.
- Next bet: LGBM baseline on raw + target-encoded categoricals, OOF probs
  from stratified 5-fold CV, then grid/Brent search over per-class
  thresholds maximizing macro-recall. Submit only after comparing OOF
  balanced accuracy of argmax vs tuned decision rule — if tuned rule
  doesn't beat argmax on OOF, re-examine before burning a sub.

## Hypothesis board

- **Open**:
  - Default `argmax` is suboptimal under balanced accuracy when classes
    are imbalanced → tuning per-class thresholds on OOF probabilities should
    move the score. Test on an LGBM baseline.
  - Incorporating the original Irrigation Prediction dataset (explicitly
    allowed) may help, but may also hurt if its DGP differs from the
    synthetic train distribution. Test as a controlled ablation.
  - The huge tie at 0.98114 suggests a "ceiling" from the public baseline
    everyone is running. Room to move is likely in (a) ensembling across
    seeds/models, (b) threshold tuning, (c) leveraging the ordinal
    structure (`Low < Medium < High`) via ordinal-aware losses despite
    the metric being order-agnostic.
- **Ruled out**: (none yet)
- **Parked**:
  - Seed recovery / DGP archaeology on the synthetic generator — high
    effort, unclear payoff with only 10 days; revisit if stuck above
    0.9815.

## Playbook

The reusable Kaggle playbook lives at
<https://github.com/chris0leite-ui/kaggle-claude-code-setup> (branch
`claude/kaggle-playbook`). Kickoff steps, workflow norms, and
methodology are maintained there — update that repo when a transferable
lesson surfaces.
